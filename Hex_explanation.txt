Explanation of the print_hex.c file because I know it's so confusing and 
I'm gonna forget how I came up with this hell : )

ft_put_hex

Notes: make_the_choice is just the function that is going to print the number in hexadecimal
       I know its a bad name, get used to it.
 
First, I find the number of times I must divide the number by 16 in order to get to
the first digit of the number
  This is because I would otherwise print the hex number in the wrong order
  This function returns the first digit as well as the number of iterations because then I
am I going to print that number 
    (turns out that (num%16) when num/16=0 has the same result as num/16 in the penultimate iteration)
  
Second, the double while... idk
  I reset the number and the counter
  I divide by sixteen as many time...
